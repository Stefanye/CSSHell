<p>Collection of common CSS mistakes, and how to fix them.</p>

<h2>What is this all about?</h2>
<p>Hi, I'm Stef√°nia, working with web since 2003. During my career I came across many lines of code, solutions, frameworks, mindsets.</p>
<p>If you have been in this industry for some time, it should not be breaking news that CSS and HTML are those parts of an application
people still underestimate. Because of that, some <em>interesting</em> code pieces are born. I'd like to preserve these lines by showing you the bad
example, explaining what's wrong with it and how to fix it.</p>
<p>With this, I hope I can help you learn and improve.</p>
<h2>Why is it called CSS Hell?</h2>
<p>It's a <s>joke</s> idea I stole from <a href="https://www.htmhell.dev/">HTMLHell</a>. I hope adding some fun and sarcasm to learning might help raising awareness of
how <strong>!important</strong> a good CSS code is.</p>
<h2>Got an issue, an idea?</h2>
